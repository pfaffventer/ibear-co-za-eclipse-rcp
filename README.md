Demo application:

A Windows 10 build of the demo app can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/pfaffventer/ibear-co-za-eclipse-rcp-demo-build-windows.git). The purpose of the application is to get a feel for the SWT components and modified data does not persist when the application terminates, I converted a PostgreSQL based application to use a SQLite in memory database, to simplify deployment for demo purposes.
