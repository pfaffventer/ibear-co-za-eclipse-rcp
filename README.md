# Database application with Eclipse RCP

Demo application: 
![alt text](https://github.com/pfaffventer/ibear-co-za-eclipse-rcp/blob/master/readme.resource/overview_000.PNG "Demo application screenshot")

A Windows 10 build of the demo app can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/pfaffventer/ibear-co-za-eclipse-rcp-demo-build-windows.git). The purpose of the application is to get a feel for the SWT components and modified data does not persist when the application terminates, I converted a PostgreSQL based application to SQLite in memory, to simplify deployment for demo purposes.

Unzip the demo.zip file to a temporary folder and double click the ‘app’ shortcut to start the application, the program works with Java 1.8 on windows 10, I have not tried it on anything else.
